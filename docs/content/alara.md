# Interaction of ultrasound

Ultrasonic waves are mechanical waves, which propagate in a medium (such
as liquid, gas, solid and biological tissue). The propagation of
ultrasonic waves is related to the transport of energy.

## Phenomena accompanying the ultrasound wave

The intensity of the ultrasound wave (the maximum pressure value)
generated by the **us4R™** should not constitute a hazard for test
subjects. Nevertheless, it is important to understand how ultrasound
interacts with tissues and realize the possible bioeffects caused by
mechanical waves.

These bio-effects fall within two categories: mechanical -- related to
the possibility of cavitation, and thermal -- related to the absorption
of wave energy by the tissue, which is converted into heat. The
amplitude of an ultrasound wave propagating in any absorbing medium,
such as a soft tissue, decreases with distance. Damping caused by the
absorption and dissipation of the wave leads to energy loss. In the
absorption process, part of the energy is converted into heat.

The user creating a new transmit schema for the us4R™ should always consider the mentioned effects of the ultrasonic wave in a given medium/propagation environment.
