# Intended Use

The Advanced Ultrasound Research Platform **(us4R™)** is an ultrasonic
system intended to be used in an uncontrolled laboratory setting for
ultrasound R&D, in particular for real-time implementation of new
imaging modalities and algorithms in biomedical and non-destructive
testing applications. **The system is not a medical device and is not
intended for use on humans.**

The **us4R™** is a fully programmable ultrasound device built on a novel
architecture optimized for streaming acquisition and software processing
of raw RF echo signals with the help of GPUs.

:::{Attention}
The device can only be operated by users with a base knowledge of programming and fundamental PC skills. It is essential that users read the full text of the instruction manual before operating the device.
