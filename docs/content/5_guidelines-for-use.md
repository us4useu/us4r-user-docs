## General Guidelines

:::{Attention}
The device can only be operated by users with a base knowledge of programming and fundamental PC skills. It is essential that users read the instruction manual in full before operating the device.
:::

:::{Attention}
Before first use, you must ensure that the device is complete and in good condition. Any mechanical damage, spillage stains or similar faults require servicing. Under no circumstances can a faulty or damaged network cable be used.
:::

:::{Attention}
Using the **us4R™** out of its intended use, or any use that has not been delineated in this manual, will lower the effectiveness of measures put in place to protect the user from danger, and result in a decrease of safety levels.
:::
  
The ready to use setup consists of the **us4R™** device, a host PC computer ({numref}`us4r+pc+conn`), an LCD monitor and a set of cables.

**As standard, a host PC, an LCD monitor, and ultrasound probes are not provided by the Manufacturer.**

The **us4R™** enables the user to simultaneously connect up to two ultrasound probes (linear/phase/convex). Two connectors (CONN_#0 and CONN_#1) are situated at the top of the device; For matrix-array probe, an dedicated probe adapter is available with 4x DLM6-360 connectors. Only a single probe (linear/phase/convex) probe connector is active at a time. An active probe is used to transmit and receive ultrasound signals that are acquired and processed by the system.
The active connector/probe is chosen in software. 
Ultrasound echo signals from the probe are digitized and transmitted via single/dual PCIe gen3 x16 digital interface to the PC, and then further to the GPU cards. Real-time data processing takes place in the CPU/GPUs. 

The processed data can be presented graphically on an LCD monitor. The LCD monitor is not supplied with the **us4R™** system and must be provided by the user. 
The LCD monitor can be connected to the PC using a dedicated DisplayPort cable.

:::{Caution}
Never unplug the probe from the device during transmission!
This can result in damage to the transmit section of the us4R™ device!

<!-- :::{Attention}
The device is not equipped with life functions monitoring or alarm systems. 
The us4R-lite™ is not designed to monitor life functions!

## Manufacturer EMC recommendations

![](img/emc.png)

The device has limited immunity to electromagnetic interference and thus
should be kept as far as possible from its sources (such as mobile
phones) during work. If additional interference signals are present and
their elimination is not possible, the registered waveforms and digital
values should be ignored.


The device has no elements sensitive to a 50Hz/60Hz magnetic field.

**§ 15.105 Information to the user.**

~~This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference in which case the user will be required to correct the interference at his own expense.~~

## Other conditions and recommendations

It is advised that the device operate at room temperature and at
moderate humidity. Any mechanical shocks should be avoided.

:::{Caution}
The Manufacturer recommends that you contact the service and perform a technical inspection (at the Manufacturer or remotely) 
if you suspect that the device has been mechanically damaged or otherwise diverges from normal appearance.
:::
  
The sole service provider for this device is the Manufacturer, us4us Ltd.

The **us4R™** is an electronic device and should be disposed of
according to existing regulations.

Production of this equipment required the extraction and use of natural
resources. The equipment may contain substances that could be harmful to
the environment or human health if improperly handled at the product's
end of life. To avoid release of such substances into the environment
and to reduce the use of natural resources, we encourage you to recycle
this product in an appropriate system that will ensure that most of the
materials are reused or recycled appropriately.

## Cleaning and maintenance of the device

The **us4R™** device should be cleaned and disinfected according to
standard procedure. However, it is essential to take additional care not
to allow any liquids into the device, as this can lead to malfunction
and the need for servicing.

The cover of the device can be cleaned with a piece of dry cloth,
ensuring no liquids are transported inside.

:::{Caution}
You must ensure that no liquids find their way inside the device!
In case of suspected spillage or moisture inside the device, 
do not connect the device to a power source or attempt to  
turn it on, but contact technical service. 
:::

If the device will not be used over the course of two or more days, it
should be cleaned and left protected from accidental damage, spillage or
contamination at a safe location.
